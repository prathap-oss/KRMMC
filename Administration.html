                    <p style="float: right; width: 70%;margin: 20px;">
                        It gives me a great sense of joy and responsibility to share with you my vision towards
                        Education that I have inherited from my forebears.</p>
                    <p style="float: right ; width: 70%; margin: 20px;">I had considerable experience in the field of
                        education and when I floated the College (KUMARARANI MEENA MUTHIAH COLLEGE) my mind was
                        preoccupied with a most important concern to preserve the rich tradition by offering education
                        with
                        the best of values, but not an education available across the counter.</p>
                    <p style="margin:20px;width: 70%;float: right;">Education, as I visualize, is not mere learning, but
                        it is fused with national pride and patriotic values, making every student aware of our rich
                        inheritance of culture and the greatness of our Nation. In different terms, making them
                        more patriotic by inculcating in them human values, crossing the borders of religion, race and
                        caste and imbibing them with real values that humanity is in need of. This is precisely where my
                        institution stands distinctly different
                        from others.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 20px;float: right;">Our logo “STRIVE, SAVE AND SERVE” speaks about our commitment.
                        The three “S”s that say ‘YES’ to value based education for which we stand for. To lead a
                        meaningful life for oneself, for the society and the entire country, is the motto
                        behind our logo – a flagship of value.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 20px;float: right;">A value-based education, as I see it, is not a mere package of
                        information to be carried but it also has to be applied practically. In reality, it has its legs
                        on ethical tradition, culture and heritage all packed as one. We believe
                        in enkindling patriotic values and a great sense of pride about our country. These are the
                        bedrock of our educational system not just scaffolding to pigeon hole our outgoing graduates
                        taking up profane jobs, but to make them more
                        challengeable to face the global scenario. We extend our horizon by going a step farther, since
                        we maintain a good rapport with the students who graduate and enter the portal of the wider
                        world.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 20px; float: right;">Our institution focuses beyond curriculum, a way to serve
                        society in social service activities, community development work, sports, extracurricular
                        activities like music, dance, theatre and holding internal competitions to nourish
                        and nurture talent. Our students participate in competitions at State and National levels and
                        have won laurels and brought honour to the institution.
                        <br><br>In short, it is a temple of learning to live with knowledge, dignity and values. All
                        these are possible only because of our committed staff. I am all praise for them. They give me
                        and the students more than I ask for and
                        on this I am pleased and indebted. They in fact breathe our values. Character-building is our
                        hallmark with the hope of making life a paradise on earth.
